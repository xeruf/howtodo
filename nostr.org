#+title: Nostr
What would a basic client to Nostr or any protocol need
to enable this kind of integrated communication?
What are the basics?

* Basics
** Posting
- referential replies (unsure about multiple parents)
- mentions by username
- adding hashtags in flowing text
- requiring a hashtag for every post
- ability to create groups (one relay per group?) and easily choose target
  -> communication with customers, or internal to specific teams, or publicly
** Viewing
- "subscribe" to specific hashtags - only view their content in the default feed
- filtering post list by hashtag by simply clicking on it in the sidebar
- full-text-search
** Advanced
- relay has to archive all messages
- forwarding to E-Mail (subscriber to a relay, both ways ideally) - E-Mail-Gateway
